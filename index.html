       <p class = "left-name"> Phillip Tran </p>
       <div class = "left-desc">
         Part-time data scientist and full time nuisance, Phillip's main interest lie primiarly in classification and prediction techinques. When he's not playing around Irvine's machine learning datasets, he spends his free time messing around with Kaggle competitions, teaching computer science, or building websites for fun (like this one!).<br><br>

       <div class = "right-desc">
        This is Rico's description! I don't know how to describe Rico. Hopefully he gives me a description or works on this page himself! I mean, I guess I could try. I think Rico is pretty cool. He knows maths and stuffs. He's also really good at CS despite being a math major. He exercises like a responsible adult and is really funny! 10/10 Would reccomend.<br><br>

        Claudiaaa!!!!! Again, hopefully she puts a proper description here. The true meme lord, has 500++ memes on her phone as short cuts. When in battle she fights using a varity of lenny faces and emojis. The de facto china-town school girl and despite being able to outdrink Chris is mistaken for 5 years his younger. :^)<br><br>

        Viv's pretty cool! Fun to talk to. Pretty good at cs! Does a lot of cool things like goes to the beach and concerts and shtuffs. You know, I hope these guys really do change their descriptions because of an employer sees this it really wouldnt look good on them. Hmmm, what should I eat tonight. I'm thinking Panda, although I've eaten that like every day now. Maybe I should actually cook something. I don't know. <br><br>

        Hi Chris! Chris is pretty cool, although I'm pretty sure he's never going to use this site so I 'unno why I'm putting in effort here. I guess just in case! I dunno, he can blog about pre-med or something. :D

        Fun fact: for some reason, I completely forgot about Eric until the very end. I don't know why. Sorry brrooo. Thats why the photo of eric looks so sad. Because he was forgotten. Side note, I really should've picked a better picture. Send me a better one pls.
