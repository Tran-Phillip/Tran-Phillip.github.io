          Welcome to my page!<br> My name is Phillip Tran, I am currently a 4th year Statistics major at UC Davis. This is a blog dedicated to cataloging my journey through machine learning and data science, and as such will generally have a bunch of unreleated data analysis and the occational project based on whatever I find interesting at the time. I truly find data science fascinating. I equate it a lot to leggos, where it starts off as a bunch of tiny pieces, scattered across a floor, then gets built up into larger machinations until finally a completed item is made!...except not really. In legos, there is always room to make something better, and certain ideas may not have been apparently the first time around. What if, a new lego set has a part that can make your creation stronger? Perhaps one also didn't think of combining these two parts together at the time to create a new mechanism. True data science is much the same, a endless process, rather than a start to end journey. I hope for this blog to help inspire people in their projects and help further their processes in the wonderful world of data science.

            Everyone just getting started with learning machine learning is always recommended to start with the Titanic dataset, mainly for it's simple to understand predictors and its potential for creative feature engineering..... <br>

        Stacking is a very popular method of ensemble learning. A derivative of stacking (called blending) was used to win the Netflix competition a while back. Stacking uses first-level learners or 'base' learners to create training data based on the learner's predictors....<br>
